				<h2>about me</h2>
				<p class="pWhenYouNeedMargin">
					My name is Jack X Ferrari. I live in Cambridge Massachusetts. While I was 
					born in Virginia and when I was young my parents lived in New York, for the 
					majority of my life I have lived in Cambridge. I live with my two parents and 
					my brother. I also have two dogs, Zelda and Mr. Bond.  They are Jack Russel 
					Terriers. My family also has a house in Gloucester and I learned to sail there. 
					Today I am the captain of the CRLS sailing team.
				</p>
				<p class="pWhenYouNeedMargin">
					For school, I go to Cambridge Rindge and Latin high school. I have always gone 
					to cambridge public schools, and have enjoyed most of my experiences. For 
					elementary school I went to the Haggerty school school and then for middle school 
					I went to Peabody. However now I am a senior and I am looking into colleges for 
					next year. This will be my final year going through the cambridge public school 
					system.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Career aspirations</h2>
				<p class="pWhenYouNeedMargin">
					I hope to have a career in computer science. I am not yet sure how 
					that career will look, but I know that I want it to be related to 
					computer science. To get this career I try to go to a college with a 
					good computer science department and learn all I can. Depending on what 
					I find most interesting at the end of college I will try to go into that
					field.
