						The University of Vermont was founded in 1791, making it the oldest school
						on my list and among the oldest schools in the country. It was the fifth 
						college founded in New England. The campus is located in Burlington VT. 
						The UVM campus is a very beautiful campus and may be the prettiest school
						on the list. UVM is a state school and as a result, it has a fairly large 
						student body. However despite being on the larger side, the schooldoes have
						a 93% job placement rate. The computer science program of UVM is also very 
						highly regarded.

					<p>
						At the University of Vermont I would likely get a BA in Computer Science. I
						want to mainly study Computer Science in college, but I do not want to give 
						up learning about history. A BA in Computer Science should allow me to accomplish 
						these goals. UVM is also located near a body of water that means that I can 
						continue to sail when I go to college. This sport is another thing that I value 
						highly and want to continue for as long as I am able. The location is also intersting
						as a contrast. It is the farthest school on my list, and if I wanted to try to get 
						away from home, then UVM would be the best school on my list. Burlington is also a very
						beautiful city. If I was to go away from home for school, the UVM campus would be the 
						campus I chose.
