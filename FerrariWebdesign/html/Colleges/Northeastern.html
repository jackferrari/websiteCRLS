					Northeastern University was founded in 1898, with the main campus 
					located in Boston near the Museum of Fine Arts. However at any given 
					time about a third of the student body is out on co-op. The co-op 
					system of Northeastern is what the school is most well known for. 
					The program will basically have students working in a company for 
					a semester, so that they can get real world experience in the field 
					that the student is studying. This co-op program helps explain 
					Northeastern's 92% job placement rateOn top of that the school also has a 
					very good study abroad program. They try to make meaningful study
					abroad options for many different areas of study. Finally in terms 
					of academics Northeastern has a fairly unique system of combined 
					majors, where you are able to combine two seemingly unrelated topics
					that you are interested in. For example, Computer-Science and History.

				<p class="pWhenYouNeedMargin">
					There are several things that draw me to Northeastern. For one thing,
					I really like the program of co-ops. I think it will be good to see
					some of the possible routes I can take for employment. If I went to 
					Northeastern, I would probably do a combined major of Computer-Science
					and History. Another draw for me to Northeastern is the location. I 
					would be fairly close to home, and I would not have to travel very far 
					when I want to visit home. Being placed in boston also gives me access 
					to the charles river. The river would give me the ability to keep sailing.
					Northeastern has a sailing team, and I would be close enough to other 
					boathouses that I have used in the past.
