						Umass Amherst was founded in 1863, and is the main school in the Umass
						system. In terms of computer science it is one of the top programs in
						the country. The computer science department is its own separate college
						in the university. Since Umass Amherst is a state school it is much 
						larger than other schools like Northeastern. However the job placement 
						rate after college is at a good 92%. The campus is located out 
						in Amherst MA, about an hour and a half from boston. However it is not
						a completely cut off location. The town of Amherst is a very nice town.
						The campus itself is also fairly nice. With a few exceptions, the buildings
						are very nice looking. The campus also includes the tallest red brick
						library in North America, which is visible in a few of the pictures. Along
						with all of that Umass Amherst's dining options are rated very highly.
						While that is not the most important factor in college quality, it 
						is a factor.

					<p>
						At Umass Amherst I would likely go for a Computer Science BA. That way I 
						would be able to continue doing classes on History alongside Computer 
						Science. In terms of Computer Science departments, Umass Amherst is very 
						strong. I know that I would be able to get a quality education there. 
						For extra curricular activities, there is a Umass Amherst sailing team.
						I would most likely join up with that team so I could continue sailing 
						in college. Umass Amherst also has a multitude of clubs that I would be 
						able to join. Umass Amherst is my option of a big school. It has many of 
						the educational merits of northeastern but far from a city center and on
						a much larger campus.
