				<h2>Hobbies</h2>
				<h3>Sailing</h3>

				<p class="pWhenYouNeedMargin">
					One of my favorite hobbies is sailing. I learned how to sail in Gloucester when I 
					was in the 5th grade. Ever since then I have loved sailing and taken advantage of
					every chance I can to go out. While originally I only sailed in Gloucester at the 
					YMCA summer camp, Today I mainly sail on the Charles River at <em>Community Boating</em>.
					When I got to high school, I joined the sailing team and since then I have risen 
					through the ranks to now become Captain. This spring is my last season sailing for
					CRLS, but I plan to sail at college if the school I choose has a sailing team.

				<h3>Video Games</h3>

				<p class="pWhenYouNeedMargin">
					Another hobby that I have put many hours into are video games. I started playing 
					games when I was in Kindergarten, since then video games have had a big impact on my
					life. I first started playing on a Gamecube, but today I mainly play games on the 
					computer. My favorite series of games would be the <em>Civilization</em> series. I love the
					way that those games combine historical influences to create a tactical game about how
					humans developed their nations. As someone who loved both history and video games, this
					game series was a match made in heaven for me.

				<h2>Favorite Food</h2>
				<img src="../media/food.jpg" alt="picture of Risotto" class="bodyImg risotto">
				<p class="pWhenYouNeedMargin">
					My favorite food is Risotto. The dish itself is creamy rice with some kind of other vegetable
					mixed in. I like it with either peas of butter nut squash. My favorite version of the dish is 
					also the version that my dad makes. In my family we make the dish about once a week. It is then
					used as a possible dinner for the rest of the week. During the winter on cold days, Risotto is 
					one of the best dinners that I have. It is also a really satisfying thing to eat. So many good 
					foods often leave you kind of wanting more, or missing the food. But Risotto fills you up and 
					is just all around enjoyable to eat.

				<h2>Favorite Place</h2>
				<img src="../media/fisherman.jpeg" alt="the fisherman memorial in GLoucester MA" class="bodyImg risotto">
				<p class="pWhenYouNeedMargin">
					One of my favorite places to go is Gloucester MA. The city is the oldest active fishing port in 
					the US, and is also home to the fisherman's memorial, which documents every fisherman who has 
					died at sea since the 1600s. The beaches there are some of the best in Massachusetts, and my 
					personal favorite. When I was in the 5th grade my family bought a beach house there, and since 
					then we have spent summers up on Cape Ann. The house itself is very small, and has in the past 
					lacked some of the amenities of our house in cambridge, but it is still an awesome place to 
					spend the summer. It was during one summer spent in Gloucester that I learned how to sail, and
					I still sail today.
