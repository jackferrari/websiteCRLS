					My name is Jack X Ferrari. I live in Cambridge Massachusetts. While I was 
					born in Virginia and when I was young my parents lived in New York, for the 
					majority of my life I have lived in Cambridge. I live with my two parents and 
					my brother. I also have two dogs, Zelda and Mr. Bond.  They are Jack Russel 
					Terriers. My family also has a house in Gloucester and I learned to sail there. 
					Today I am the captain of the CRLS sailing team.
				</p>
				<p>
					For school, I go to Cambridge Rindge and Latin high school. I have always gone 
					to cambridge public schools, and have enjoyed most of my experiences. For 
					elementary school I went to the Haggerty school school and then for middle school 
					I went to Peabody. However now I am a senior and I am looking into colleges for 
					next year. This will be my final year going through the cambridge public school 
					system.

	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<h3>Sailing</h3>
		<img src="../media/420boat.jpg" alt="420 sailing over waves">
			<br>
			<p>
				One of my favorite hobbies is sailing. I learned how to sail in Gloucester when I 
				was in the 5th grade. Ever since then I have loved sailing and taken advantage of
				every chance I can to go out. While originally I only sailed in Gloucester at the 
				YMCA summer camp, Today I mainly sail on the Charles River at <em>Community Boating</em>.
				When I got to high school, I joined the sailing team and since then I have risen 
				through the ranks to now become Captain. This spring is my last season sailing for
				CRLS, but I plan to sail at college if the school I choose has a sailing team.

		<h3>Video Games</h3>
		<center><img src="../media/Civ.jpg" alt="cover art for Civilization VI"></center>
			<p>
				Another hobby that I have put many hours into are video games. I started playing 
				games when I was in Kindergarten, since then video games have had a big impact on my
				life. I first started playing on a Gamecube, but today I mainly play games on the 
				computer. My favorite series of games would be the <em>Civilization</em> series. I love the
				way that those games combine historical influences to create a tactical game about how
				humans developed their nations. As someone who loved both history and video games, this
				game series was a match made in heaven for me.

	<h2>Favorite Food</h2>
	<center><img src="../media/food.jpg" alt="picture of Risotto"></center>
		<p>
			My favorite food is Risotto. The dish itself is creamy rice with some kind of other vegetable
			mixed in. I like it with either peas of butter nut squash. My favorite version of the dish is 
			also the version that my dad makes. In my family we make the dish about once a week. It is then
			used as a possible dinner for the rest of the week. During the winter on cold days, Risotto is 
			one of the best dinners that I have. It is also a really satisfying thing to eat. So many good 
			foods often leave you kind of wanting more, or missing the food. But Risotto fills you up and 
			is just all around enjoyable to eat.

	<h2>Favorite Place</h2>
	<center><img src="../media/fisherman.jpeg" alt="the fisherman memorial in GLoucester MA"></center>
		<p>
			One of my favorite places to go is Gloucester MA. The city is the oldest active fishing port in 
			the US, and is also home to the fisherman's memorial, which documents every fisherman who has 
			died at sea since the 1600s. The beaches there are some of the best in Massachusetts, and my 
			personal favorite. When I was in the 5th grade my family bought a beach house there, and since 
			then we have spent summers up on Cape Ann. The house itself is very small, and has in the past 
			lacked some of the amenities of our house in cambridge, but it is still an awesome place to 
			spend the summer. It was during one summer spent in Gloucester that I learned how to sail, and
			I still sail today.

						Northeastern University was founded in 1898, with the main campus 
						located in Boston near the Museum of Fine Arts. However at any given 
						time about a third of the student body is out on co-op. The co-op 
						system of Northeastern is what the school is most well known for. 
						The program will basically have students working in a company for 
						a semester, so that they can get real world experience in the field 
						that the student is studying. This co-op program helps explain 
						Northeastern's 92% job placement rateOn top of that the school also has a 
						very good study abroad program. They try to make meaningful study
						abroad options for many different areas of study. Finally in terms 
						of academics Northeastern has a fairly unique system of combined 
						majors, where you are able to combine two seemingly unrelated topics
						that you are interested in. For example, Computer-Science and History.

			<div class="sectionHeader"><h3>My Plans at Northeastern</h3></div>
			<div class="sectioninfo">
				<div class="sectionP">
					<p>
						There are several things that draw me to Northeastern. For one thing,
						I really like the program of co-ops. I think it will be good to see
						some of the possible routes I can take for employment. If I went to 
						Northeastern, I would probably do a combined major of Computer-Science
						and History. Another draw for me to Northeastern is the location. I 
						would be fairly close to home, and I would not have to travel very far 
						when I want to visit home. Being placed in boston also gives me access 
						to the charles river. The river would give me the ability to keep sailing.
						Northeastern has a sailing team, and I would be close enough to other 
						boathouses that I have used in the past.
